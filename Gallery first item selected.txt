I have a screen with a gallery and a form. The form is, of course, supposed to display the selected gallery item, which I am storing in a variable. So the Item property of the form is set to varSelectedProject. 

 

On the OnVisible property of the SCREEN, I set varSelectedProject as follows:


Set(varSelectedProject,First(GalleryProjectFiles.AllItems))
